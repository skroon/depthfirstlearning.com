<h1 id="why">Why</h1>

<p>AlphaGoZero was a big splash when it debuted and for good reason. The grand effort
was led by David Silver at DeepMind and was an extension of work that he started
during his PhD. The main idea is to solve the game of Go and the approach taken
is to use an algorithm called Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This algorithm acts as an expert guide to teach
a deep neural network how to approximate the value of each state. The convergence
properties of MCTS provides the neural network with a founded way to reduce the
search space.</p>

<p>In this curriculum, you will focus on the study of two-person zero-sum perfect
information games and develop understanding so that you can completely grok
AlphaGoZero.</p>

<p><strong>Motivation</strong>: Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning are original ideas that blossomed
  from the study of games starting in the 50s. To this day, they are components in 
  strong game-playing computer engines like Stockfish. In this class, we will go
  over these foundations, learn from Prof. Knuth’s work analyzing their properties,
  and prove that these algorithms are theoretically sound solutions to two-player
  games.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong>:</p>

  <li>Knuth: Show that AlphaBetaMin <script type="math/tex">= G2(p, \alpha, \beta) = -F2(p, -\beta, -\alpha) = -</script>AlphaBetaMax. (p. 300)
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>If \(d = 0\), then \(F2(p, \alpha, \beta) = f(p)\) and \(G2(p, -\alpha, -\beta) = g(p) = -f(p)\)
as desired, where the last step follows from equation 2 on p. 295.
</p>
<p>Otherwise, \(d &gt; 0\) and we proceed by induction on the height \(h\). The
base case of \(h = 0\) is trivial because then the tree is a single root and
consequently is the \(d = 0\) case. Assume it is true for height \(&lt; h\),
then for \(p\) of height \(h\), we have that \(m = a\) at the start of
\(F2(p, \alpha, \beta)\) and \(m\prime = -\alpha\) at the start of \(G2(p, -\beta, -\alpha)\). So
\(m = -m\prime\).
</p>
<p>In the i-th iteration of the loop, let's label the resulting value of \(m\)
as \(m_{n}\). We have that \(t = G2(p_{i}, m , \beta) = -F2(p_i, -\beta, -m) = -t\)
by the inductive assumption. Then,
\(t &gt; m \iff -t &lt; -m \iff t\prime &lt; m\prime \iff m_{n} = t = -m_{n}\prime\),
which means that every time there is an update to the value of \(m\), it will
be preserved across both functions. Further, because
\(m \geq \beta \iff -m \leq -\beta \iff m\prime \leq -\beta\), we have that \(G2\) and
\(F2\) will have the same stopping criterion. Together, these imply that
\(G2(p, \alpha, \beta) = -F2(p, -\beta, -\alpha)\) after each iteration of the
loop as desired.

  </li>
  <li>Knuth: For Theorem 1.1, why are the successor positions of type 2? (p. 305)
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>By the definition of being type 1, \(p = a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{l}\), where
each \(a_{k} = 1\). Its successor positions \(p_{l+1} = p (l+1)\) all have length
\(l + 1\) and their first term \(&gt; 1\) is at position \(l+1\), the last entry.
Consequently, \((l+1) - (l+1) = 0\) is even and they are type 2.
</p>
</details>
  </li>
  <li>Knuth: For Theorem 1.2, why is it that p’s successor position is of type 3
if p is not terminal?
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>If \(p\) is type 2 and size \(l\), then for \(j\) s.t. \(a_j\) is the first entry where
\(a_j &gt; 1\), we have that \(l - j\) is even. When it's not terminal, then its
successor position \(p_1 = a_{1} \ldots a_{j} \dots a_{l} 1\) has a length of
size \(l + 1\), which implies that \(l + 1 - j\) is odd and so \(p_1\) is
type 3.
</p>
</details>
  </li>
  <li>Knuth: For Theorem 1.3, why is it that p’s successor positions are of type 2
if p is not terminal?

<p>This is similar to the above two.</p>

<h1 id="2-multi-armed-bandits--upper-confidence-bounds">2 Multi-Armed Bandits &amp; Upper Confidence Bounds</h1>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong>: The multi-armed bandits problem is a framework for understanding 
  the exploitation vs exploration tradeoff. Upper Confidence Bounds, or UCB, is 
  an algorithmically tight approach to addressing that tradeoff under certain
  constraints. Together, they are important components of how Monte Carlo Tree 
  Search (MCTS), a key aspect of AlphaGoZero, was originally formalized. For 
  example, in MCTS there is a notion of node selection where UCB is used extensively. 
  In this section, we will cover bandits and UCB.</p>

<h1 id="3-policy--value-functions">3 Policy &amp; Value Functions</h1>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong>: Policy and value functions are at the core of reinforcement 
  learning. The policy function is the representative probabilities that our
  policy assigns to each action. When we sample from these, we would like for 
  better actions to have higher probability. The value function is our estimate 
  of the strength of the current state. In AlphaGoZero, a single network 
  calculates both a value and a policy, then later updates its weights according
  to how well the agent performs in the game.</p>

<p>
On-policy algorithms learn from the current policy's action decisions.

<h1 id="4-mcts--uct">4 MCTS &amp; UCT</h1>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong>: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) forms the backbone of AlphaGoZero.

<p>We can reuse the accumulated statistics in subsequent runs. We could also

in actual implementations.
</p>
</details>
  </li>
  <li>What characteristics of a domain would make MCTS a good algorithmic choice?
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>
A few such characteristics are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>MCTS is aheuristic, meaning that it does not require any domain-specific
knowledge. Consequently, if it is difficult to produce game heuristics for
your target domain (e.g. Go), then it can perform much better than alternatives
like Minimax. And on the flip side, if you did have domain-specific knowledge,
MCTS can incorporate it and will improve dramatically.
</li>
<li>
If the target domain needs actions online, then MCTS is a good choice as all
values are always up to date. Go does not have this property but digital games
like in the <a href="http://ggp.stanford.edu/">General Game Playing</a> suite
may.
</li>
If the target domain's game tree is of a nontrivial size, then MCTS may be
a much better choice than other algorithms as it tends to build unbalanced
trees that explore the more promising routes rather than consider all routes.
&lt;/li&gt;
<li>
If there is noise or delayed rewards in the target domain, then MCTS is a
good choice because it is robust to these effects which can gravely impact
other algorithms such as modern Deep Reinforcement Learning.
</li>
</ul>
</details>
  </li>
  <li>What are examples of domain knowledge default policies in Go?
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>
<ul>
<li>Crazy Stone, an early program that won the 2006 9x9 Computer Go Olympiad,
used an
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Examples-of-move-urgency_fig2_220174551">urgency</a>
heuristic value for each of the moves on the board.
</li>
<li>
MoGo, the algorithm that introduced UCT, bases its default policies on this
sequence:
  <ol>
  <li>Respond to ataris by playing a saving move at random.</li>
  <li>If one of the eight intersections surrounding the last move matches a
  simple pattern for cutting or <i>hane</i>, randomly play one.</li>
  <li>If there are capturing moves, play one at random.</li>
  <li>Play a random move.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li>The second version of Crazy Stone used an algorithm learned from actual
game play to learn a library of strong patterns. It incorporated this into
its default policy.
</li>
</ul>
</details>
  </li>
  <li>Why is UCT optimal? For a finite-horizon MDP with rewards scaled to lie in
  <script type="math/tex">[0, 1]</script>, can you prove that the failure probability at the root converges
  to zero at a polynomial rate in the number of games simulated?
    <details><summary>Hint</summary>
<p>
Try using induction on \(D\), the horizon of the MDP. At \(D=1\), to what
result does this correspond?
</p>
</details>
    <details><summary>Hint 2</summary>
<p>
Assume that the result holds for a horizon up to depth  \(D - 1\) and
consider a tree of depth \(D\). We can keep the cumulative rewards bounded
in the interval by dividing by \(D\). Now can you show that the UCT payoff
sequences at the root satisfy the drift conditions, repeated below?
</p>
<ul>
<li>The payoffs are bounded - \(0 \leq X_{it} \leq 1\), where \(i\) is the
arm number and \(t\) is the time step.</li>
<li>The expected values of the averages, \(\overline{X_{it}} =
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} X_{it}\), converge.</li>
<li>Define \(\mu_{in} = \mathbb{E}[\overline{X_{in}}]\) and \(\mu_{i} = \lim_{n\to\inf} \mu_{in}\).
Then, for \(c_{t, s} = 2C_{p}\sqrt{\frac{\ln{t}}{s}}\), where \(C_p\) is a
suitable constant, both
\(\mathbb{P}(\overline{X_{is}} \geq \mu_{i} + c_{t, s}) \leq t^{-4}\) and
\(\mathbb{P}(\overline{X_{is}} \leq \mu_{i} - c_{t, s}) \leq t^{-4}\) hold.
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="5-mcts--rl">5 MCTS &amp; RL</h1>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong>: Up to this point, we have learned a lot about how games can be
  solved and how reinforcement learning works on a foundational level. Before we 
  jump into the paper, one last foray contrasting and unifying the games vs 
  learning perspective is worthwhile for understanding the domain more fully. In 
  particular, we will focus on a paper from Vodopivec et al. After completing 
  this section, you should have an understanding of what research directions in
  this field have been thoroughly explored and which still have open directions.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What are key differences between MCTS and RL?</li>
  <li>UCT can be described in RL terms as the following “The original UCT searches
  identically as an offline on-policy every-visit MC control algorithm that uses
  UCB1 as the policy.” What do each of these terms mean?
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>
<ul>
<li>
UCT is trained on-policy, which means it improves the policy used to make the
action decisions, i.e. UCB1.
</li>
<li>
The offline means that we can't learn until after the episode is completed.
An alternative online algorithm would learn while the episode was running.
</li>
<li>
Every-visit versus first-visit decides if we are going to update a state for
every time it's accessed in an episode or just the first time. The original
UCT algorithm did every-visit. Subsequent versions relaxed this.
</li>
<li>
MC control means that we are using Monte Carlo as the policy, i.e. we use
the average value of the state as the true value.
</li>
</ul>
</details>
  </li>
  <li>What is a Representation Policy? Give an example not described in the text.
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>A Representation Policy defines the model of the state space (e.g. in
the form of a value function) and the boundary between memorized and
non-memorized parts of the space.
</p>
</details>
  </li>
  <li>What is a Control Policy? Give an example not described in the text.
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>A Control Policy dictates what actions will be performed and (consequently)
which states will be visited. In MCTS, it includes the tree and default policies.

<h1 id="6-the-paper">6 The Paper</h1>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong>: Let’s read the paper! We have a deep understanding of the background,
  so let’s delve into the apex result. Note that we don’t just focus on the final
  AlphaGoZero paper but also explore a related paper written coincidentally by
  a team at UCL using Hex as the game of choice. Their algorithm is very similar
  to the AlphaGoZero algorithm and considering both in context is important to 
  gauging what was really the most important aspects of this research.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What were the differences between the two papers “Mastering the Game of Go
  Without Human Knowledge” and “Thinking Fast and Slow with Deep Learning and Tree Search”?
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>Some differences between the former (AG0) and the latter (ExIt) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>AG0 uses MC value estimates from the expert for the value network
where ExIt uses estimates from the apprentice. This requires more computation
by AG0 but produces better estimates.</li>
<li>The losses were different. For the value network, AG0 uses an MSE loss
with L2 regularization and ExIt uses a cross entropy loss with early stopping.
For the policy part, AG0 used cross entropy while ExIt uses a weighted
cross-entropy that takes into account how confident MCTS is in the action
based on the state count.</li>
<li>AG0 uses the value network to evaluate moves; ExIt uses RAVE and rollouts,
plus warm starts from the MCTS.</li>
<li>AG0 adds in Dirichlet noise to the prior probability at the root node.</li>
<li>AG0 elevates a new network as champion only when it's markedly better than
the prior champion; ExIt replaces the old network without verification of if
it is better.</li>
</ul>
</details>
  </li>
  <li>What was common to both of “Mastering the Game of Go Without Human Knowledge”
  and “Thinking Fast and Slow with Deep Learning and Tree Search”?
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>The most important commonality is that they both use MCTS as an expert
guide to help a neural network learn through self-play.</p>
</details>
  </li>
  <li>Will the system get stuck if the current neural network can’t beat the previous ones?
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>No. The algorithm won’t accept a policy that is worse than the current best
and MCTS’s convergence properties imply that it will eventually tend towards
the equilibrium solution in a zero-sum two player game
</p>
</details>
  </li>
  <li>Why include both a policy and a value head in these algorithms? Why not just use policy?
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>Value networks reduce the required search depth. This helps tremendously
because a rollout approach without the value network is inaccurate and spends
too much time on sub-optimal directions.
